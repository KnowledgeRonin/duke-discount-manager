# Duke Discount Manager System

Duke Discount Manager is a modern web application designed to streamline the creation, editing, and management of discount templates for a business environment with and user-friendly interface that centralizes all operations into a single authenticated user.

The project is built entirely from scratch with a forward-thinking architecture focused on scalability, maintainability, and performance.


## Technologies Used

- React (with functional components and hooks)
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui (for a clean, consistent, component-driven UI)
- Turbopack (development bundler included in Next.js)

## Environments Used

- Runtime: Node.js 18+
- Framework: Next.js 14+
- Package Manager: npm / pnpm / yarn
- Development Server: Turbopack (via next dev)
- Styling System: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables
- UI Components: shadcn/ui library

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
